The Story
---------

"Math Quiz Online" is a online math game that was created for schools to help with learning and when the lockdown started it was needed more for home student learning but it was useful when schools went back!  
I originally started the game as a silly little hobby while in school but in the end when it really to go, when the time was I published it to the internet on GitHub and on my website for all to play!  
But the game development has slowed down because of other things but will take in ideas for when I get back to it, but I do have plans for future updates that will improve the game and all feedback is good!

Gameplay (how to play)
----------------------

- Hey, some things to know before playing the game! There is now a new [guide book](#gallery8) for the new players to the game so they can get started, but surely and can work out how to use a box that says "enter your name" anyway ðŸ˜€.
- Second thing is also very simple, just choose your settings that decides what sums your going to get in your game (the [difficulty](#gallery5) and [target](#gallery4)), your score will be shown under the [question](#gallery2) counter. The [difficulty](#gallery5) will decide the [question](#gallery2) types of the available which are **Addition, Subtraction and Times Tables** for you to challenge yourself with and just [answer the sums](#gallery2).
- When you start a round you will start with 3 lives getting an answer wrong you will lose a life. But if you get a [question](#gallery2) correct you will earn points and get extra points when you win based on your lives remaining.
- And also with [missions](#gallery7) as an extra challenge to make the game last longer but as of the latest update, there is a basic reward system. And at the end there is a screen to [show your name and score](#gallery6) as your achievement, and it can be printed off too.
